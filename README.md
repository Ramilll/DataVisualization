# DataVisualization

## The main idea of the project is to visualize titanic dataset using streamlit app

I utilized pandas, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib to make visual diagramms to show the data from the dataset and to explore outliers, linear relationships between the data

Here is a link to streamlint app: https://ramilll-datavisualization-streamlit-app-nbn590.streamlit.app
